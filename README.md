🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine LearningThis repository contains a comprehensive Machine Learning project focused on predicting the resale value of cars based on various features such as manufacturing year, current price, mileage, and fuel type.📌 Project OverviewIn the automotive industry, determining the accurate market value of a used vehicle is crucial for both buyers and sellers. This project implements and compares two different regression algorithms—Linear Regression and Lasso Regression—to build a predictive model that estimates car prices with high accuracy.📊 Technologies & LibrariesThe project is implemented in Python, leveraging the following data science stack:Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.Scikit-learn: For model building, data splitting, and performance evaluation.🛠️ Workflow and MethodologyData Preprocessing:Handled categorical variables (Fuel Type, Seller Type, and Transmission) using manual encoding to transform them into a machine-readable format.Checked for missing values and analyzed the dataset structure.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Visualized the distribution of categorical features.Analyzed the correlation between features and the target variable (Selling_Price).Model Selection & Training:Split the dataset into Training (90%) and Testing (10%) sets.Trained a Linear Regression model as a baseline.Trained a Lasso Regression model to introduce regularization and prevent potential overfitting.Performance Evaluation:Evaluated models using the R-squared ($R^2$) metric to measure the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables.
